I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Harvard University. My research interests are in public economics. I'm particularly interested in regulation and social and environmental programs. I am on the academic job market this year (2023-2024).

I received my B.A. in economics and environmental studies from Brown University in 2016. My CV can be found <a href="http://jenna-anders.github.io/files/Anders_CV_2023.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
