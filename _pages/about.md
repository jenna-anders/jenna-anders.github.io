I am a S.V. Ciriacy-Wantrup postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley ARE. Starting fall of 2025, I will be an assistant professor at the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy at the University of Virginia.

I received my PhD in economics from Harvard in 2024, and my B.A. in economics and environmental studies from Brown University in 2016.

My research interests are in public economics and environmental economics. I'm particularly interested in regulation and social and environmental programs.

My CV can be found <a href="http://jenna-anders.github.io/files/Anders_CV_2023.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
