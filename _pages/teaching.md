* I have been a teaching fellow for graduate labor economics (taught by Larry Katz) and a large, introductory undergraduate course on applied microeconomics (taught by Raj Chetty).
* I have developed my own course material for a basic introduction to Stata organized by the PREDOC consortium.
	* For this course, I created a collection of datasets useful for teaching dataset transformation (append, merge, collapse) and regression in Stata. The datasets include album-level and track-level information about four Beatles albums, including album ratings, track length, lead vocalists, and the number of song plays on Spotify (at the time I made the datasets). You can download the datasets [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dilt20h2jmh5q6q/AADtLnq4KP6S_wlSVFGjpFJja?dl=0). <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dilt20h2jmh5q6q/AADtLnq4KP6S_wlSVFGjpFJja?dl=0" target="_blank">here in a new tab</a>
