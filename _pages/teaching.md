* I have been a teaching fellow for graduate labor economics (taught by Larry Katz) and a large, introductory undergraduate course on applied microeconomics (taught by Raj Chetty).
* I have developed my own course material for a basic introduction to Stata organized by the <a href="https://predoc.org/" target="_blank">PREDOC consortium</a>.
	* For this course, I created a collection of datasets useful for teaching dataset transformation (append, merge, collapse) and regression in Stata. The datasets include album-level and track-level information about four Beatles albums. You can download the datasets <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dilt20h2jmh5q6q/AADtLnq4KP6S_wlSVFGjpFJja?dl=0" target="_blank">here</a>.
